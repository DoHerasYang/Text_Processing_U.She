 I'm interested in mechanisms for communicating between disjoint processes,
possibly, but not exclusively, in a distributed environment.  I would
rather see descriptions of complete mechanisms, with or without implementations,
as opposed to theoretical work on the abstract problem.  Remote procedure
calls and message-passing are examples of my interests.

 Articles describing the relationship between data types and concurrency
(e.g. what is the type of a process?  when is a synchronization attempt 
between two processes "type correct"?  in a message-passing system is there
any notion of the types of messages?--i.e. any way to check that the sender
of the message and the receiver are both treating the bit stream as some
particular type)
</document>

<document docid=38>
 What is the type of a module?	(I don't want the entire literature on
Abstract Data Types here, but I'm not sure how to phrase this to avoid it.
I'm interested in questions about how one can check that a module "matches"
contexts in which it is used.)
</document>
