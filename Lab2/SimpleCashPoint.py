Scenrio: 
        A bank user approaches the ATM and inserts their card.We imagine that the ATM then reads the card details and uses them to access key 
information from the bank’s central computer, namely: 
        (i) the card owner’s true PIN
        (ii) their current balance.

        The ATM then calls the code that you will write, which checks that the user knows the correct PIN, and if so, then provides ATM services 
to the user.

TODO:
        Download the code files SimpleCashpoint.py and test_cashpoint.py from the module home page, and open them in Spyder. The first file 
(SimpleCashpoint.py) contains a ‘dummy’ (i.e.empty) definition of the cashpoint function, which consists of a single print statement (which
prints a message that the function has not yet been defined). It is your task to complete this function definition, so as to implement the system 
described by the flowchart.
